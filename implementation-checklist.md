## üî≤ **REMAINING TASKS:**

### IMMEDIATE (Required):

#### 1. Deploy Database Changes
```bash
cd supabase
npx supabase db push
```

#### 2. Add Trial Blocking Logic
Add to lead import functions:
```javascript
// In backfillLeads function
const { data: trialCheck } = await supabase.rpc('is_trial_expired', { brand_id_param: brandId });
if (trialCheck) {
  setShowTrialModal(true);
  return;
}
```

#### 3. Test New User Flow
1. Create fresh account with new email
2. Verify brand creation works
3. Check trial countdown in database

#### 4. Update Lead Limits Check
Currently only checks lead count, should also check trial expiration:
```javascript
// Add to existing limit checks
if (trialStatus?.status === 'trial_expired') {
  showToast('Trial expired! Please upgrade to continue.', 'error');
  setShowTrialModal(true);
  return;
}
```

### ENHANCEMENT (Recommended):

#### 1. Trial Dashboard Widget
Show trial status prominently:
- Days remaining
- Usage progress
- Upgrade CTA

#### 2. Email Notifications
- Day 6: "1 day left" reminder
- Day 7: "Trial expired" notice
- Follow-up emails

#### 3. Grace Period (Optional)
Allow 1-2 days grace period with limited access

#### 4. Trial Extension (Customer Service)
Add admin function to extend trials:
```sql
SELECT extend_trial(brand_id, 7); -- Extend by 7 days
```

## üìä **TESTING SCENARIOS:**

### New User Signup:
1. ‚úÖ Sign up with fresh email
2. ‚úÖ Verify email confirmation
3. ‚úÖ Check brand creation in database
4. ‚úÖ Verify trial starts (7 days from now)

### Trial Expiration:
1. üî≤ Manually set trial_ends_at to yesterday
2. üî≤ Refresh app - modal should appear
3. üî≤ Try to import leads - should block
4. üî≤ Test upgrade flow

### Database Queries for Testing:
```sql
-- Check user's brand and trial status
SELECT b.*, bts.* 
FROM profiles p 
JOIN brands b ON p.brand_id = b.id 
LEFT JOIN brand_trial_status bts ON b.id = bts.id 
WHERE p.id = 'USER_ID_HERE';

-- Manually expire trial for testing
UPDATE brands 
SET trial_ends_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day' 
WHERE id = YOUR_BRAND_ID;

-- Reset trial for testing
UPDATE brands 
SET trial_ends_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '7 days' 
WHERE id = YOUR_BRAND_ID;
```
